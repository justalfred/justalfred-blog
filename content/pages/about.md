Title: About the Site
Author: Just Alfred

Hello. I'm just another Alfred.
I'm a data scientist.
Formerly, I was on the analytics team at [Paperless Post](http://www.paperlesspost.com/), and before that I was on the Science team at [Bitly](http://bitly.com/).
Doctorate in Experimental Condensed Matter Physics.
Math and music nerd.

I'm using this as a place to share some thoughts, put ideas to the test, and possibly educate.
If you'd like to respond to anything I write, email me.
Take the name of this blog with no spaces, add a '.blog' to that, and that's the gmail account I created.

Welcome, and I hope you enjoy.
