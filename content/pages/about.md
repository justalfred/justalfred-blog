Title: About the Author
Author: Just Alfred

Hello. I'm just another Alfred.
I'm a former physicist and data scientist.
I've worked on data science at a few different startups and a major bank.
I'm currently managing projects at a nonprofit.
But after all this technical work, lately I've been thinking more about how to be human.
This has taken me on a jaunt through the humanities.
I have so much more to explore.

I'm using this as a place to share some thoughts, test some ideas, and possibly educate.
I want more people to thoughtfully share their experiences with the world through media like blogs.
This is me leading by example.
If you'd like to respond to anything I write, email me at:

Welcome, and I hope you enjoy.
