Title: About the Author
Author: Just Alfred

Hello. I'm just another Alfred.
I'm a former physicist and data scientist.
My data science career has led me through startups, a major bank, a nonprofit, and independent consulting.
Now I'd call myself a translator between data science and the real world.
Lately I've been more interested in the peculiarities of being human.
This has taken me on a jaunt through the humanities.
I have so much more to explore.

I'm using this as a place to share some thoughts and test some ideas.
I want more people to thoughtfully share their experiences with the world through media like blogs.
This is me leading by example.

Welcome, and I hope you enjoy.
