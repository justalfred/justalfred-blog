Title: About the Site
Author: Just Alfred

Hello. I'm just another Alfred.
I'm currently somewhere between a data engineer, data analyst, and data scientist at [Paperless Post](http://www.paperlesspost.com/).
Formerly on the Science team at [Bitly](http://bitly.com/).
Doctorate in Experimental Condensed Matter Physics.
I'm just trying to make up for the time I've lost and help others along the way.

I'm using this as a place to share some thoughts I have that it seems few others are having.
Or at least that few others are sharing.
If you'd like to respond to anything I write, email me.
Take the name of this blog with no spaces, add a '.blog' to that, and that's the gmail account I created.

Welcome, and I hope you enjoy.
