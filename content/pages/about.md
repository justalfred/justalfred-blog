Title: About the Site
Author: Just Alfred

Hello. I'm just another Alfred.
I'm a former physicist and data scientist.
Recently, I worked at [White Ops](https://www.whiteops.com),
[Paperless Post](https://www.paperlesspost.com/),
and [Bitly](https://bitly.com/).
My doctorate was in Experimental Condensed Matter Physics, but lately, I've been thinking more about how to be human.
This has taken me on a jaunt through the humanities.
I have so much more to explore.

I'm using this as a place to share some thoughts, put ideas to the test, and possibly educate.
I want more people to share their experiences with the world through media like blogs.
This is my lead by example.
If you'd like to respond to anything I write, email me at:

Welcome, and I hope you enjoy.
