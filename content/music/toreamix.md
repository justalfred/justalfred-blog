I write a blog post on remixes, and in less than a week I discover a
perfect example of a high-concept remix album being released by Tori
Amos.  I confess I am not familiar with her discography, but I gather
that her latest album, [Night of
Hunters](http://www.npr.org/2011/09/11/140261371/first-listen-tori-amos-night-of-hunters),
is an exceptional one.  You can listen to it in its entirety for free at
the link, presumably until the release date of September 20.

This album is released on the esteemed German classical label, Deutsche
Grammophon.  It's a modern day *song cycle*.  These
[collections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterreise) of
[songs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_die_ferne_Geliebte) centered
around a common [theme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwanengesang)
were popular in the late Classical and Romantic eras and are worthy of a
post of their own.  In this case, a continuous narrative spans the
entirety of the cycle.  Each song is essentially a remix of pieces
spanning 400 years.  Amos's vocals and piano work are accompanied by,
among others, the principal clarinetist of the Berlin Philharmonic, an
award-winning string quartet, and her daughter and niece.  
  
The lyrics (libretto?) follow one half of a "shattering" couple on a
spiritual journey through space and time with a childlike shape-shifter
as guide.  Many of the individuals met along the way are represented by
various instruments.  The story resolves in acceptance of individual
misfortune and appreciation of the vaster calamities in the world.
([Amos explains her album
here.](http://www.echodust.com/2011/08/track-by-track-introduction-to-tori.html#more)) 
Why such a mythical narrative for this moral?  In Amos's
[words](http://www.out.com/detail.asp?page=1&id=31598): "I decided to
take it to a place that I understood and a place that has mythology,
because good song cycles -- there's a level of otherworldliness --
that's why it works. To me, if it doesn't have a poetic subtext going
on, and the characters don't come in that take us on some kind of
spiritual quest, then I don't think it will last for 50 years or 100
years. It has to transcend time in a way -- and yet reflect the time
you're in."  Wagner would wholeheartedly
[agree](http://www.wnyc.org/articles/music/2004/mar/02/the-ring-and-i-the-passion-the-myth-the-mania/).  
  
I invite you to listen to the album even if you don't have time to
analyze the lyrics.  I haven't had the chance to sit for that long
myself.  But it's wonderful music.  I leave you with the track listing
with links to the sources for each song.  Enjoy!
