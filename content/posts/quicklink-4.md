Just a single link for you today.  Life has been incredibly busy since
my last post.  It will continue to be very busy for the next month.  But
I can at least squeeze in posts like this one.  I came across [this fun
piece](http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2011/03/01/134160882/classical-music-shred-fest-which-pieces-get-you-pumped-up?ft=1&f=129702125)
in the blog I've mentioned before.  I don't really agree with a couple
of his examples as being "metal," but certainly you can imagine a heavy
metal cover of any of these pieces.  In fact, you can imagine heavy
metal covers to a lot of classical pieces.  Compare the opening to
Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto no. 2 and Muse's Space Dementia, and
you'll hear clear similarities.  Or check out Epica's album, "The
Classical Conspiracy" for several cool rocked out versions of classical
music.  What classical pieces would you like to hear remixed into heavy
metal or sound metal to you in their own right?
