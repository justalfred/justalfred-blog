This is somewhat old news now.  Anthony Tommasini, classical music
critic for the NYT, started the year posing the question, "Who are the
10 greatest composers in history?"  The subsequent
[articles](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/arts/music/09composers.html)
and
[videos](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/01/07/arts/music/20110107-top-ten-composers.html)
are thoughtful and present something of a quick tour through music
history.  The rest of the articles are listed
[here](http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/top-10-composers/) in
reverse chronological order.  The final list is announced
[here](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/arts/music/23composers.html). 
It's just for fun.

a story that demonstrates why one must be thoughtful if one is to
command an international audience without inadvertently insulting
people.
