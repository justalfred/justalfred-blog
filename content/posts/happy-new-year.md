Happy New Year, folks.  Something something auld lang syne.  This blog
is still young and impressionable, so maybe this is a good time to tweak
its direction.  Anything you'd like to see more or less of?  Do I link
too many YouTube videos?  Do you even watch them?  I aim to please.  You
know what would please me?  If you come up with illustrations, examples,
or counter-examples of the things I mention here, especially from music
that's not classical, share them with me!  I would love more dialogue.  
  
In parting, here's a tune to bid farewell to the old year: [Chopin Piano
Sonata No. 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCzEQTP_Ks)
