Heard about this from NPR today:

Or for the YouTube channel directly:

This music critic goes through popular songs and rates each section
(identified in the upper right) on the instrumental, lyrical, and vocal
aspects with notes when appropriate. (It's a little awkward when he
can't get permission to play the actual song...) It's rather subjective,
of course. But it's still an interesting look at how one critic makes
his judgments. What I found most useful is seeing the sections
identified (i.e. the form of the piece). You may notice a frequent
formula emerge from the more banal songwriters. Enjoy.
