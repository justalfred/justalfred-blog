Summary: Present

I entered the next room in the contemporary art room at the Corning Museum of Glass and was drawn immediately to the pure forms.
A figure represented in printed, offset [glass plates]({static}../images/plates.jpg);
a large, slightly bulging [cube of black glass]({static}../images/black_cube.jpg).
Then I found Nicole Chesney's [Present](http://www.cmog.org/collection/rakow-commission/nicole-chesney).
A nacreous, abstract atmosphere painted and wiped across a glass canvas.
And I started to think.

This is pretty. Why? Do others find it pretty? Would I have found it pretty ten years ago?
Will I find it pretty in ten years? What am I supposed to see? Why does it matter?
What do other people think about when they take the time to experience this piece? Is that what matters?
Are we connected somehow? I don't see a story or an object or a scene. Just a feeling.
It feels delicate. It exhibits *wabi-sabi*. I want to protect this.
It's not Japanese, and yet it feels Zen all the same.
I see a faint, clouded reflection of myself. I feel like I'm here, but I'm not.
Approaching *muga*. I start to detach. I want others to see this and experience it.

And with these thoughts in mind, I made my own art.
