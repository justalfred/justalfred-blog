## Commentary
This year I have learned, forgotten, grown, regressed, smiled, and suffered.
I'm still grasping for control and searching for meaning, but with less judgment.
I'm better able to help the people around me, and it turns out there's nothing more fulfilling to me.
I've retracted into my shell somewhat, but it's richer inside than before.
This year, I want to share more of it with the people who would see.
Thank you, my friends.
