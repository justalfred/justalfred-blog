Summary: Welcome to my new blog.

Back when I was in grad school, I started a blog to satisfy an itch to write.
I used Blogger at the time because it was free and easy to set up.
Now it seems the reputation of that platform has gone the way of AOL.
Also, now that I work in the software industry, I have new blogging needs.
So I've decided to restart my blog in this new format.
I hope it's one that will be easy to migrate in the future should the need arise.

There's a lot of work left to do.
I'm in the process of migrating my old posts over here.
I'll also post my process for starting this.
I haven't decided whether or not to allow comments.

But the intent of this blog is to help me clarify my thinking around topics that are important to me.
Either personally or professionally.
I'm looking forward to learning a lot in this process.
