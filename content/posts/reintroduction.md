Summary: Welcome again to my old blog.

As with so many projects, blogs in particular, mine suffered inattention after the initial excitement of setting it up wore off and the demands of life took over.
So here's take two on the revival of this outlet.
I have a couple guides in the works detailing starting a blog in Pelican and installing Arch linux, but I intend to share smaller posts more often.
Topics will range from data science to computer science to physical science, music to math to madness.
Keep an eye out for posts coming soon.
I hope you enjoy.
