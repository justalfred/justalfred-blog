Summary: Evolution just happens. In a lot of places.

So these COVID variants.
Wild, huh?
Seems like every month, there's a new, "stronger" variant to worry about.
Who knew the virus could "learn" so fast to "evade" our immune systems?
Will vaccines make it evolve faster into a deadly super-virus, the way antibiotics lead to superbugs?

All of these questions are based on a common but inaccurate understanding of evolution.
Viruses have no goals, they aren't colluding, and evolution doesn't actually make them more or less severe.
Evolution doesn't _do_ anything, but is _a thing that happens_.
Given how little we've done about the pandemic, the waves and explosion of variants that we've seen are perfectly well explained by random mutations of viruses that are as lifeless as t-shirts.
Don't believe me?
Let's start with the fundamentals.

Let's talk really generally about any kind of system composed of interacting stuff.
Let the stuff interact, and structures and patterns will invariably emerge.
_Things_ will come and go.
Coins in a jar shaken around will organize into stacks, cosmic matter will arrange into stars and galaxies, inorganic gases [will react into complex organic molecules](https://www.nature.com/articles/d43978-021-00144-0), etc.
Inorganic gases could also readily form short-lived, reactive compounds, but after things settle, they will have reacted away.
Black holes, by contrast, form very rarely, but are very stable, so we find lots of them.
We can state tautologically that **stabler things tend to exist longer**.
Their rarity only affects how long we have to wait before we see one.

Now let's talk about systems where the interacting things are complex and have some mechanism for copying.
We can classify similar things into _forms_, and we can do this however we like.
Because copying tends to be inexact, we'll find that the characteristics of a form shift or blur over time, and forms can even branch into new forms or go extinct.
The things that constitute a form might only exist for a blink of an eye, but if they're copied fast enough, the form can potentially persist indefinitely.
This means we can compare the longevity of forms like we just did for things.
As with things, we can state tautologically that **fitter forms are more likely to persist**.

Et voilà, we have evolution! Mutations occur randomly, and less fit forms drop off while fitter ones multiply, making the form fitter over generations—no intent required.
Eventually the forms will look exquisitely designed, even though they're just the accumulations of eons worth of self-selected adaptations to the world and to each other.
That's the intuition, but we need more details to think through specific cases.
Namely, what is fitness, and how does selection happen?

**Fitness only makes sense relative to a particular _context_.**
(To a niche, in evolution-speak.)
How fit is a frog?
Very fit in the pond, not so much in the street.
Let's say our frogs spawn a mutant that can survive for weeks outside of water.
Will we see frogs with this mutation next year?
A lot of things have to happen.
The frog has to survive long enough, find a mate, reproduce, and the new mutant frogs need to survive and do the same.
Its odds of doing this are improved if it means it can venture further out of the pond to access new resources.
Unless there aren't any useful resources out there to be found.
Its odds may be harmed if the trait also makes it slower and more vulnerable to predators.
If the mutants do survive, they would probably coexist with the original frogs.
Until one year a drought dries up the pond for a week.
So fitness also depends on the time scale we're looking at, and benefits may not be apparent for several generations.

The point is that fitness cannot be measured or calculated because of the chaos of nature.
It can only be considered observationally and probabilistically, again relative to a specific context.
**Fitness is not determinative.** If you're thinking that this doesn't sound very much like "survival of the fittest", that is astute.
In fact, that phrase didn't enter Darwin's _Origins_ until the 5th edition, and it's confused students and libertarians ever since.
He preferred it to "natural selection" to avoid the suggestion of nature as an agent doing the selecting.
In my opinion, it's worse since it implies an ongoing competition where only the fittest, the best, survive.
In actuality, the fittest don't always survive, less fit forms frequently survive, multiple forms coexist in any context, and anyway the boundaries around forms and contexts are shifty, imaginary constructs that we invent in order to have useful conversations[^1].
"Survival of the fittest" could never be a rule when the concept of fitness is so completely contingent.

If "fitness" is not an objective, intrinsic property of anything, but rather depends on how you pose the question, then evolution could not possibly have a telos.
It's preposterous to suggest that Evolution™ is "striving" to realize the "perfect" frog or virus.[^2] Neither is SARS-CoV-2 learning anything any more than yeast is learning anything.
Neither does a new COVID wave mean it got stronger than our immune systems could handle.
They can't be 'evading vaccines' because vaccines don't persist in your body.[^3] The unfortunate term 'immune evasion' does not refer to the virus gaining sneakiness or any other abilities.
It means: the new variant is shaped differently enough from the versions that your immune system has learned about that it takes a bit more time to register and respond, perhaps enough for an infection to get started.[^4]

Let's back up one step to illustrate further.
The whole thing with viruses is that they get copied repeatedly by their hosts.
(Remember, they don't trick the host to copy them because they want to continue existing.
Rather, they continue existing because they are things that the host will make copies of.) Copying errors can occur, so our discussion of evolution applies.
The mutations happen randomly.
They are as likely to degrade the virus as to enhance it.
In fact, they're probably much more likely to degrade it since you would expect only quite specific mutations to enhance it.
But with millions of people infected at any moment worldwide, and especially with some people sustaining active infections for several months, with so many rolls of the dice, every now and then a mutant copy gets lucky.

Lucky means high fitness.
Humans are the context/niche, and high fitness means being able to jump to new human hosts.
This _requires_ being shaped differently enough that other hosts' immune systems don't immediately recognize it—immune evasion.
Other traits like reproducing faster or surviving longer in the air also increase fitness since they help with spreading to more people, but remember that the mutations are random.
The news isn't that the variants keep getting worse or stronger or sneakier.
It's that the rare, high-fitness variants are the ones that make the news.
Indeed, by now, [thousands of variants](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation/blob/master/lineage_notes.txt) have been identified, but only few have been notable.

So am I saying the virus is actually getting weaker?
No.
Although it's true that hospitalization and fatality rates here in the US have declined considerably since the start of the pandemic, that is due to most people having acquired long-term cellular immunity—the part that kicks in a little later but keeps things from getting bad—from vaccination and infection.
I am saying that aside from the traits that impact fitness, other traits (like making kids' eyes sticky) are random and just come along for the ride.

Am I saying that the virus won't get more severe or deadly?
Also no.
You can argue that these traits lower fitness since people would take the disease more seriously, and if they die they can't go around infecting others.
This may be true.
But let's not confuse cause and effect.
We can't say a very deadly variant _won't_ occur because it would have low fitness.
We can only say that _if_ a very deadly variant occurs, it will have lower fitness in some sense.
We can be more nuanced, even.
If a new variant kills most people before they become contagious, it would not be able to spread far.
If a new variant kills most people well after they've stopped being contagious, then it will spread just as well as if it didn't kill anyone.
It could still have a very high fitness in the short term.
The people it killed won't be around for future variants, but COVID isn't thinking about that because it doesn't think.

That covers COVID.
I'm reminded of [simulations of why multicellular organisms can't live forever](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1618854114).
As I've argued, evolution happens anywhere things interact and are copied.
This includes among the cells of a human body.
Human cells normally function in a cooperative balance, but they acquire mutations over time.
Some of these mutant cells are defective and are cleared.
Some are aggressively successful, disrupting the balance.
Cancer cells are able to consume the body's resources and reproduce beyond the body's capacity, leading to the death of the host.
If you ask about the next day, these are the fittest cells, the most successful.
If you ask about the next year, these cells are the least fit, the most doomed.

Cultures are forms that can interact, persist, be copied, and evolve.
Some have likened capitalism, with its unquenchable demand for unceasing growth, to cancer.
The cultures carrying capitalism as a trait have grown successfully and selfishly at the expense of the rest of the ecosystem.
The trait has also spread to other cultures through mechanisms like global development banks enforcing capitalist economic activity in indebted nations.
Many people see little hope of stopping this cancer from killing its host: humanity and nature.

But forms comprise diverse things with diverse characteristics, and this itself is a trait of the form.
Diversity enhances robustness.
The wildlife in the area around Chernobyl is different from what was native prior to the accident, but it's [thriving](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-chernobyl-has-become-unexpected-haven-wildlife) all the same.
If organisms are around that can live in a niche, they will, and they will even evolve to flourish.
The only question is how much biodiversity will endure, and how long the regenerative process will take.

Not all cultures are infected with capitalism's extractive, competitive logic.
Prior to the violence of colonization, many indigenous cultures in the Americas were stewards of the land they lived on, taking not more than their share, creating the land's famous fertility.
If the present world order collapses, cultures like these will have a chance to move freely and reconstitute humanity in conversation with the remains of the natural world.
I'm not suggesting a reversion to pre-modern modes of life.
Rather, the spirit of cooperation, humility, and reverence for nature that were frequent traits of these cultures will lend themselves to the longevity of future cultures whatever their genealogy, finding a healthier relationship to the tools of technology and the enterprise of science.
This is my best hope for the distant future.

[^1]: Valid forms include frogs, tree frogs, or the specific frogs in our pond.
Valid contexts include the pond, ponds in the region, city ponds, ponds in general, North America, etc.
When we inquire about the fitness of one of these forms in one of these contexts over the last generation, over the last century, or over the Holocene, we should expect to answer the question very differently.
Nature doesn't 'care' what questions we ask and correspondingly doesn't 'care' what we have to say about fitness.

[^2]: Likewise, **there is no possible perfect human form**—only someone's personal fantasy of such.
Anyone arguing for perfecting humans must be named eugenicists, unscientific and irrational, and opposed vehemently.

[^3]: The way vaccines function is to give your immune system a practice run clearing out SARS-CoV-2 antigens so that it'll be primed and ready for the real thing.
The vaccine isn't persistent.
Your immunological memory is.

[^4]: An individual's immune system _does_ learn in a meaningful sense from infection and vaccination, albeit with differences depending on specifics (what proteins are present, how they're delivered, where the antigens are deposited, etc.).
The human immune system is wondrous and complex, and understanding viral kinetics with respect to the different immune responses is essential to understanding why breakthrough infections happen, why 'immune evasion' is both expected and short-lived, and why vaccination does not accelerate evolution.
See [Vaccines Will Not Produce Worse Variants](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/vaccines-will-not-produce-worse-variants) for a fuller discussion of much of the above.
