### The Atheist (me, hopefully not any time soon):

Not just yet! Oh, not just yet! <br />
There is so much left to learn! <br />
I have obligations to fulfill! <br />
Let me do more good. <br />
Let me do more good. <br />

### Death (also me):

Give me your hand, you fragile, defeatist soul! <br />
I am a friend, and come not to judge. <br />
Your debts are paid! You've earned friends' love, <br />
Surrender your sensations to serenity! <br />
