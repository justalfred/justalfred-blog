Summary: A talk I gave. Not exciting. Maybe useful.

I wish I could make all this prettier, but I gave a talk at
[PyGotham](https://2016.pygotham.org/).
It's not my best work since I'm not actually terribly experienced with the
subject matter. But it does represent packaged knowledge that I wish I had
when I was getting started with Spark.

A few people asked for slides, so this is my attempt to post them. I'm not
bothering with making reveal.js work, so it's all one long html doc. Sorry
it's not prettier. I know what pretty looks like; I don't know how to make
pretty things.

Well, for what it's worth, I present to you
[the slides]({static}/html/PyGotham2016.html)
to "Spark Dataframes for the Pandas Pro".
