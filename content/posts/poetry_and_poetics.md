Summary: I took another BISR class. The mental exercise was very healthy.

Regular readers know [my affection]({filename}literary_theory.md)
for the [Brooklyn Institute for Social Research](https://thebrooklyninstitute.com/about/).
([Take a class](https://thebrooklyninstitute.com/current-courses/), you won't regret it.)
I just finished yet another fabulous class, this time titled Poetry and Poetics, again with
[Rebecca Ariel Porte](https://thebrooklyninstitute.com/people/rebecca-ariel-porte/).
I thought only a poetic summary could properly honor what I learned, though it's by no means comprehensive.
I start with a frivolous prelude.

### Prelude

Identical if two by three, or three by two,<br>
Or one by two by three, or one and two and three.<br>
So it’s triangular. As is its square. (Add one<br>
Through eight. (fun, in semitones it’s half an octave<br>
(Western, of course).)) A perfect number: sum its primes.<br>
Tilings, snowflakes, quarks, Bach's Ricercar, sestinas...<br>

### I listen, I think, I speak

I have lately sought Beauty in greater measure<br>
To chance upon more Truths. So BISR's "Poetry<br>
And Poetics" drew me straight to the signup form.<br>
I'd written some, and heard my speech has a lyric<br>
Quality, but didn’t know how to read an ode,<br>
Sonnet, epic, or poem by another name.<br>

We must be very considerate with a Name.<br>
Both Power and Existence, in equal measure,<br>
Start thereof. Who decides what gets to be an Ode?<br>
What gets to be? What can we ask of Poetry?<br>
Must it be useful? or do nothing? like lyric<br>
Equations: lossy compressions of nature’s form?<br>

Structure may inform. How queer that, like games, a Form<br>
Enables and constrains. Do [poems] earn the name<br>
If Form-less? What affordances do song lyrics<br>
Offer the composer of their feet and measures<br>
Versus sonnets? Does Form serve more the Poetry<br>
Reader, lighting a path? Let's probe the case of Odes.<br>

Misdirection. (I led myself astray.) If Ode<br>
Is a Genre, its Species conform not to Forms<br>
But have other common qualities. Poetry<br>
Will do what it will, though. Even a poem named<br>
"Ode to..." may not be. No one has the one measure.<br>
Let’s make our mental models meek, even lyric.<br>

All groupings are subject—does Lyric mean lyric?<br>
Are Lyrics all lyrical? Where do we place Odes—<br>
Within or touching? The bounds of Lyric measure<br>
Greater over history. Concept drift. No form<br>
Of analysis will define for all the name<br>
Of Lyric. I say we each own a Poetry.<br>

I sing for you my newborn sense of Poetry.<br>
I want to hear your song. Render me a lyric.<br>
Bestow upon a state of your self a fit name—<br>
A poem. As a niche, I'll send the fittest odes<br>
On to see evolve Poetry’s diverse forms<br>
And scatter some sententious seeds for good measure.<br>

I want for the Platonic form of Poetry<br>
To reside outside measure to preserve its name.<br>
I'll drink poems instead. Hail, fluid Lyrics, Odes!<br>
