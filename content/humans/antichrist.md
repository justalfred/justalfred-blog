Summary: It's only logical.

Correlation is not Causation. Any student of statistics has heard this repeated
time and again. But the world is complex and dynamic, and our mental capacity
has to fit in the 20-Watt, 3 pound organic mass inside our skulls. We're wired
to see patterns and when we notice B happen right after A enough times, we're
liable to think "A caused B". This is good for the survival of the primitive
human. But we are not primitive. Are we? Perhaps to prove we are not, there
were those philosophers as Leibniz who went so far as to deny that
causation even really existed.

But any reasonable person would accept that we can justifiably say that
"A causes B" provided a governing model and evidence to support said model.
Fire causes burns. This is useful and, moreover, reliable. It's not a far
stretch from there to allow statements of the form "A prevents B". From there,
"The absence of A causes B" or "The absence of A prevents B".

And so, given an acceptance of causation, through action and inaction
we have effects on the world. Note that these aren't usually easy or possible
to trace (see chaos theory or the butterfly effect).
Given that every event could have generated a multitude of outcomes (even
the staunch determinist has to allow for the probabilistic nature of
quantum mechanics) there are an infinity of possible worlds that never come
to be.

In a subset of these possible worlds, our inactions or actions permit or
create a person who brings as much concurrent peace, harmony, and joy to
humanity as is possible. A savior.

But we have acted or not acted, and thus this person does not exist. Our
actions have prevented this person, or the absence of our actions have
prevented this person. This person could have existed in an infinity of
forms, and some of these (an infinity of these) have been rendered impossible
by us.

We could all have effected a different chain of events, but we did not.
We could all have brought into being a savior to the world or become one
ourselves, but we did not. Our awareness of this effect is irrelevant. A
murderous machine is defective and requires termination regardless of its
awareness of its nature.
Therefore we are all guilty of causing harm to humanity. We are all sinners.

Of course, this same line of reasoning can also bring us to its opposite
conclusion. Logic is fun!
